     *  For example, the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by Isocitrate dehydrogenase

     *  carbon dioxide is constantly removed from the system. Usage: A separate catalysis 
     *  instance should be created for each different conversion that a physicalEntity 
     *  may catalyze and for each different physicalEntity that may catalyze a conversion. 
     *  For example, a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two different biochemical 
     *  reactions would be linked to each of those biochemical reactions by two separate 
     *  instances of the catalysis class. Also, catalysis reactions from multiple 
     *  different organisms could be linked to the same generic biochemical reaction

     *  a biochemical reaction by an enzyme, the enabling of a transport interaction

     *  a scaffold protein. Hexokinase -&gt; (The "Glucose + ATP -&gt; Glucose-6-phosphate

     *  in. Na+ from cytoplasm to extracellular space would be described in a transport 
     *  instance. K+ from extracellular space to cytoplasm would be described in a 
     *  transport instance. The ATPase pump would be stored in a catalysis instance 
     *  controlling each of the above transport instances. A biochemical reaction 
     *  that does not occur by itself under physiological conditions, but has been

     *  across different contexts and molecular states, that share common physical 
     *  properties and often named and treated as a single entity with multiple states 
     *  by biologists. Rationale: Many protein, small molecule and gene databases 
     *  share this point of view, and such a grouping is an important prerequisite 
     *  for interoperability with those databases. Biologists would often group different 
     *  pools of molecules in different contexts under the same name. For example 
     *  cytoplasmic and extracellular calcium have different effects on the cell's 
     *  behavior, but they are still called calcium. For DNA, RNA and Proteins the 
     *  grouping is defined based on a wildtype sequence, for small molecules it is 
     *  defined by the chemical structure. Usage: Entity references store the information 
     *  common to a set of molecules in various states described in the BioPAX document, 
     *  including database cross-references. For instance, the P53 protein can be 
     *  phosphorylated in multiple different ways. Each separate P53 protein (pool) 
     *  in a phosphorylation state would be represented as a different protein (child 
     *  of physicalEntity) and all things common to all P53 proteins, including all 
     *  possible phosphorylation sites, the sequence common to all of them and common 
     *  references to protein databases containing more information about P53 would 
     *  be stored in a Entity Reference. Comments: This grouping has three semantic 
     *  implications: 1. Members of different pools share many physical and biochemical 
     *  properties. This includes their chemical structure, sequence, organism and 
     *  set of molecules they react with. They will also share a lot of secondary 
     *  information such as their names, functional groupings, annotation terms and 
     *  database identifiers. 2. A small number of transitions seperates these pools. 
     *  In other words it is relatively easy and frequent for a molecule to transform 
     *  from one physical entity to another that belong to the same reference entity. 
     *  For example an extracellular calcium can become cytoplasmic, and p53 can become 
     *  phosphorylated. However no calcium virtually becomes sodium, or no p53 becomes 
     *  mdm2. In the former it is the sheer energy barrier of a nuclear reaction, 
     *  in the latter sheer statistical improbability of synthesizing the same sequence 
     *  without a template. If one thinks about the biochemical network as molecules 
     *  transforming into each other, and remove edges that respond to transcription, 
     *  translation, degradation and covalent modification of small molecules, each 
     *  remaining component is a reference entity. 3. Some of the pools in the same 
     *  group can overlap. p53-p@ser15 can overlap with p53-p@thr18. Most of the experiments 
     *  in molecular biology will only check for one state variable, rarely multiple, 
     *  and never for the all possible combinations. So almost all statements that 
     *  refer to the state of the molecule talk about a pool that can overlap with 
     *  other pools. However no overlaps is possible between molecules of different
